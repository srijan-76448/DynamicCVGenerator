## Name:
  wkhtmltopdf 0.12.6 (with patched qt)

## Synopsis:
  `wkhtmltopdf [GLOBAL OPTION]... [OBJECT]... <output file>`

## Document objects:
  wkhtmltopdf is able to put several objects into the output file, an object is either a single webpage, a cover webpage or a table of contents. The objects are put into the output document in the order they are specified on the command line, options can be specified on a per object basis or in the global options area. Options from the Global Options section can only be placed in the global options area.

  A page objects puts the content of a single webpage into the output document.

  `(page)? <input url/file name> [PAGE OPTION]...`<br>
  Options for the page object can be placed in the global options and the page options areas. The applicable options can be found in the Page Options and Headers And Footer Options sections.

  A cover objects puts the content of a single webpage into the output document, the page does not appear in the table of contents, and does not have headers and footers.

  `cover <input url/file name> [PAGE OPTION]...`<br>
  All options that can be specified for a page object can also be specified for a cover.

  A table of contents object inserts a table of contents into the output document.

  `toc [TOC OPTION]...`<br>
  All options that can be specified for a page object can also be specified for a toc, further more the options from the TOC Options section can also be applied. The table of contents is generated via XSLT which means that it can be styled to look however you want it to look. To get an idea of how to do this you can dump the default xslt document by supplying the `--dump-default-toc-xsl`, and the outline it works on by supplying `--dump-outline`, see the Outline Options section.
